# Easter_Day_AnyYear- The Date_of_Easter.py file is the main file.

This calculator calculates the date of April for any year in the range of 1900-2099.
The program uses the custome restart function module so implement that somewhere within a directory and make sure to change the "from..." line in the main file.

I originally got the idea from ch 7 of the "How to think like a computer scientist: Learning with Python" book and modified it to escape textbook boredom for a bit.
Make sure to create an __init__.py file for the Restart_Function module.
